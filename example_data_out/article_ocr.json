John Guthrie, of Greenock, at the An-\nti-Slavery Meeting lately held in this city, made the\nfollowing statements :\u2014\n\nThe resolation I have the honor to submit to this\nmeeting supposes that the Christians in America\ncannot be indifferent to the opinion formed of them\nby the Christians in Great Britain. This, surely, it\ns quite safe and sober toassume. Such populations\nns those of China and Japan can afford to be very\nyery indifferent to foreign opinion and influence;\nthey can afford to be so by dint of their comparative\nbarbarism, which leads them to barallsuch influence\nout. But it is not, and cannot be so with any civil-\nized nation\u2014mnch less with America, which, be-\nsides being civilized, is to so large an extent Chris-\ntianized, and is, moreover, peculiarly impressible to\nBritish infinence, as a people of the same stock, and\nwho speak the same tongue. This last circumstance,\nviz., a community of language, is one of the most po-\ntent of all keys by which two nations can unlock\ntheir way to each other\u2019s hearts, and that even\nthrough the most crooked and intricate wards of na-\ntional prejudice and prepossession. Such a key we\nhave in our noble\u2019 language\u2014and, O, what sympa-\nthies, what facilities, what persuasives, what glorious\nthoughts, embalmed in,our common literature in gen-\neral, in our Christianized literature in particular, does\nit vpen ap to Christians on each side of the Atlantic,\nfor all the ends of good influence, and that in the\nlargest s@ale ! In strictest harmony with these plain\nples are all the facts in the case ; for even a\nglance at American newspapers is sufficient\nto.show that at public meetings there held on the\nslavery, no small prominence is given to\nBritish opinion on the question, and considerable in-\nterest ana excitement are often thereby created.\u2014\nSuch is the implement, which, in connection with\nothers, and especially in the spirit of faith, and love,\nand prayer, the ladies of this excellent Society wish\nBritlsh Christians to wield, with combined earnest-\nness and energy, on the American mind. My mo-\ntion makes mention of two tremendous evils, in the\neclipse of which, the American stars \u2018burn dim and\nburn too often, alas! only to shed disastrous influ-\nence. The one of these is slavery, -on the evils,\nand horrors, and aggravated criminality of which\u2014\nin a land especially \u2018that boasts so much and often so\njustly of advancement\u2014it is not necessary, after\nwhat we have heard, that I should detain you a sin-\ngle moment. The other evil is infidelity. How\nmelancholy to reflect that New England, the land of\nthe pilgrim fathers\u2014the land that echoed, not merely\nto the tread and hum of industry, but to the prayers\nand the praises of as noble and_ vali: int-hearted men\nas ever suffered for the truth and right\u2014should at\nthis hour be infested with schools of infidelity\u2014to\nbe found here and there, like knots of serpents on its\nbosom\u2014some of which are a bastard product of the\nphilosophy, falsely so called, that so much prevails in\nGermany, while others betray a socialistic origin,\nand agitate questions subversive alike of all reveal-\ned religion, and all civil government, with a zeal that\noften reaches the wildest and most furious fanaticism.\nA company of this latter description, whose head-\nquarters are Boston, have been long identified with\nthe anti-slavery movement in America. By some easy\nrefinements, their newspaper, with the infidel profani-\nties it ever and anon vomits forth, is shown, as often as\noccasion requires, to be not the formal and technical\norgan of the Anti-Siavery Society with which these\nBostonian gentlemen stand connected. It so hap-\npens, however, that abolition and infidelity are ad-\nvocated together, and not only so, are unblushingly\nidentified. The sweet waters and bitter flow from\nthe same fotintain, and become in consequence all\nbitter together. The gentlemen whom I refer to,\nare men of peace. They would not handle daggers\n\u2014no, not they! They would not handle thei, but\nthey speak them; they writethem. Like tne apoca-\nlyptic monster, they have \u2018horns like a lamb,\u2019 bat\nthey \u2018 speak like a dragon.\u2019 They base abolitionism\non directly infidel principles. \u2018hey propose infidel\nresolutions at public meetin They do their. ut-\nmost to identify Christianity and slavery ; and to in-\noculate with this poison every fugitive slave that\ncomes in their way; and, instead of contenting\nthemselves with striking at slavery through whatever\nchurches and other influences they can, without\nquestioning their motives or their honest desire to\nsee slavery abolished, we yet venture to say, that on\ntoo. many occasions they seein to be most in their el-\nement, when they aima blow, through slavery, at\nthe very heart of the Churches, and of that Holy Re-\nligion, of which, with all their faults, the American\nChurches are the shrines. If, then, these Churches\nwould only wash their hands of the fou! blot of sla-\nvery, the most envenomed arrows of infidelity would\nthat moment lose their point. [The speaker here\nstated some facts with a view to prove that the Am-\nerican Churches were doing much tore for the abo-\nlition of slavery than is commonly imagined.] Such\nis the drift of the motion, which, without further\ntrespassing on your time, I would respectfully pre-\nsent to this meeting. I would only, in my closing\nsentence, bespeak your support in behalf of this truly\nChristian and excellent Society. It interferes not\nwith others. It sets up no tests\u2014-its existence, on\nthe contrary, is a protest against all such; for while\ni, aims zealously at the immediate abolition of all\nslavery, and wishes well to all who are engaged in\nthe same cause, though in different ways, it only\nclaims to conduct its efforts so as not to compromis\nprinciples dearer to us than life. We are no apolo-\ngists of the American Churches that are mixed up\nwith slavery. I, for my part, cold interchange no\nfellowship w itb them. But we wish to deal with\nthem in such a) (wer as not to aim at their subver-\nsion, but to rest ain, if possible, in the spirit of\nmeekness, and get them to realise the blessed prom-\nise :\u2014\u2018If thou take away from the midst of thee the\nyoke, the putting forth of the finger, and speaking\nvanity ; and if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry,\nand satisfy the afflicted soul; then shall thy hght\nris\u00e9 in obscurity, and thy darkness be as the noon-\n\nday,\u2019\n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n     \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n   \n\n \n\n   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTHE COLONIZATION SPIRIT.\n{\" Here is a specimen of the spirit which animates\nthe Colonization crusade in this country\n\n \n\nIn every part of che United States, there is a broad\nand impassable line of demarcation between every\nman who has one drop of African blood in his veins,\nand every other class in the commanity. The hab-\nits, the feelings, all the prejudices of society\u2014preju-\ndicos which neither refinement, nor argument, nor\nreligion itself, can sobdue\u2014mark the people of color,\nbond or free, as the subjects of a degra pation inevi-\ntable and incurable. The African ins country\nbelongs by birth to the very lowest station in socie-\nty; and from that station he can never tise, be his\ntalents, his enterprise, his virtues what they may...\nThey constitate a class by themselves\u2014a_ class out\nof which no individual can be elevated, and bejow\nwhich none can be depressed.\u2014.4/rican Repository,\nvol. iv., pp 118, 119.\n\n \n\n \n\f"

The Boston\nJournal has the following :\u2014\n\n\u2018*Poverty.\u2014In a room in an old shell of a house in\nShinbone Alley, which leads out of Endicott strect,\nthere resides, or rather exists, a woman named Cathe-\nrine Shean, with three children, who are entirely\ndestitute of focd and clothing, and have nothing but\nthe bare floor to sleep on, with two palm leaf mats\nfor their covering. An>ther woman named Elizabeth\nNelson, having four children, is also a tenant of the\nsame room, and in nearly as destitute circumstances\nas Mrs. Shean.\u2019\n\nQuery.\u2014If Northern fanatics have so much philan-\nthropy as they would have us believe, how does it\nhappen that helpless females are allowed to groan and\ndie under the pinchings of poverty in the midst of\nplenty?\n\nNow, we would respectfully ask the editor of the\nHerald, what he means by the word \u2018fanatics\u2019?\nDoes he design the epithet as descriptive of those.\nwho hold the unjyersal brotherhood of man and pa-\nternity of God; and the uncbristian character of ev-\nery institution which forcibly excludes men from the\nmeans of education, improvement and happiness;\nand the duty of all Christians to labor, by Christian\nmeans, to reform the evils that are in the world, the\ngreatest as well as the least? Does he design the\nepithet for such men as John Adams, Benjamin\nFranklin, Roger Sherman, Thomas Jefferson, Rob-\nert R. Livingston, and the host of other American\npatriarchs und statesmen, who labored to exclude\nfrom the American frame-work of government the\nright and power to make chattels of \u2018MEN?? But\nwhy should he deem it a strange thing that men\nof such principles should not be able to prevent all\ncases of suffering and poverty in Boston? The two\nwomen spoken of in the above itein from the Boston\nJournal, are Irish women; and these people are\nflocking by thousands to our shores, and lodging in\nour city, in poverty and wretchedness, all of whom\nwe cannot take to our houses, if we would. Nor\ncan we know the particular condition of this class of\npeople in general, unless some particular circum-\nstance brings one and another to notice, for the rea-\nson that they are Catholics, kept by the influence\nof their creed and the policy of their priesthood as a\nseparate Hation within a nation. Nothing would'be |\nmore fearful to the Catholic hierarchy than the free |\nintermingling and intercourse of their people with\nProtestants, in social relations and sympathies. But\nthe priests, who control immense funds for sectari-\nan purposes, are ina way to know these cuses of suf-\nfering among their own people ; and they are thorough-\nly pro-slavery. There is no taint in them of the fa-\nnaticism of republicanism, They love the \u2018pecaliar\ninstitutions\u2019 of the South. Why, then, do they not\nrelieve their suffering sisters ?\n\nAnd then a majority of the citizens of Boston, at\nleast of men of property and standing, are pledged\nfriends of slavery. Hon. Rufus Choate declares that\nthere must not, there must not, there MUST not, be\nany ggitation against it; and he represents the pop-\nular sentiment of Boston, we think. Not that they\nwould have slavery created, if it were not in being.\nBut as it is, they would have it forever cherished.\nWhy, Bro. Herald, do not this class of our citizens\nrelieve all distresses, even before they become\nknown?\n\nIn conclusion, we have to say, that while we have\nno disposition to urge our Southern preachers to\nmake martyrdom certain by direct attacks on slavery,\nwe regret that they should officiously cater to the cor-\nrupt principles of oppressors, by contemptuous sneers\nat the principles of universal progress. We cannot\nregard this as the means by which they can acquire\nthe greatest honor and influence even in the South.\n\n \n\f"

Among the opponents of the cause, he was\nnever embarrassed\u2014never ata loss for words; but\nin the presence of its friends, he scarcely knew what\ntosay., Mr. G. went on to describe the contrast be-\ntween the scene by which he was now surrounded\nand that presented only twenty-four hougs previous,\nwhen an American wife and mother had called on\nhim at his room in Washington, to beg him to do\nsomething to save her from an eterna] separation\nfrom her husband, who had been sold to a slave-\ntrader, and unless speedily redeemed by the inter-\nposition of warm-hearted friends, must go off to the\nfar South to drag out a miserable existence amidst\nthe horrors of the plantation. Although cases like\nthis were of frequent occurrence in Washington,\nand well known to those who made laws for the\npeople, they excited very little attrntion. During\nthe whole fourteen years he had been a member of\nCongress, he had never heard the Chaplain of the\nHouse offer a single prayer for the wretched victims\nof oppression who were confined in the prisons of\nthe District of Columbia, and who, torn away from\nkindred and friends, were ready to be shipped or\ndriven off in chains to the far South. Claiming to\nbe ministers of Him who came to proclaim liberty to\nthe captives and the opening of the prison to them\nthat were bound, they utterly excluded the slaves\nfrom the circle of their sympathies, On one occa-\nsion, several years ago, just after he had finished an\nanti-slavery speech in the House, he was told that\nsomebody wished to see him in the recess. On pass-\ning out the Chaplain, Mr. Tustin, introduced him\nto Rev. Dr. Wylie, of Scotland, a delegate to this\ncountry from the Free Chureh. The Doctor there-\n\u2018upon complimented bim for the anti-slavery speech\nwhich he (Mr. G.) had delivered ; in reply to which\nhe said, in the hearing of Mr. Tustin, \u2018I have to do\nall the preaching and praying for the slaves in the\nHouse, for our Chaplain here, though he prays for\n\n \n\f"

Dr. Wylie, turning to\nthe Ghaplain, with a most expressive glance, asked,\n\u2018Brother Tustin, is this true?\u2019 Mr. T. was very\nmuch embarrassed, and could only stammer out, \u2018 O,\nwe don\u2019t think it would be prudent to make any allu-\nsion to the subject\u2019 Mr. Giddings commented very\nseverely upon such conduct on the part of a man who\nclaimed to be a minister of Christ.\nMr. Giddings spoke about an hour and a half, dur-\ning which time he held the undivided attention of\n\u2018the audience. He reviewed the present aspects of\nthe anti-slavery cause as it stands connected with\n\ncurrent political events, and expressed the belief |\n\nthat the signs of the times were never more encour-\naging than now. Having been compelled to stand\nduring his address, we took no notes, and cannot\nundertake to present our readers even with a sketch\nof what fell from his lips. It is enough to say that\nhe thrilled the whole assembly by his fearless utter-\nance, and especially by his denunciations of the Fu-\ngitive Law, which he said he would trample under\nhis feet as an unholy thing, and an outrage upon the\nConstitution. His allusions to the Christiana affair,\nand to the efforts of the Government to hang peacea-\nble citizens of Pennsylvania as traitors, were raptu-\nrously applauded. He made no secret of his admi-\nration and approval of the conduct of the blacks in\nfighting for their freedom, and said that if be were a\nslave, he would take his liberty if he bad to walk\nover the dead bodies of slaveholders all the way\nfrom the borders of Kentucky to the Canada line,\nHe thanked God that so strong was the hostility to\nthis infernal law among the people of the Western\nReserve, \u2018that the whole army and\u201cnavy of the\nUnited States could never enforce it there.\n\nWhen Mr. Giddings had concluded his address,\nLucretia Morr arose, and while expressing her\ndissent from those portions of his speech which\nsanctioned violence, thanked him, on behalf of the\nManagers of the Fair and of the abolitionists gen-\nerally, for his kindness in appearing upon our plat-\nform, and for his manly vindication of the rights of\nthe slave. She also expressed thanks to Josuva\nHurcatnson for his musical aid, which had afforded\nso much delight to the audience. Some one sug-\ngested that she ought not to forget Mr. Furness,\nwhen she answered, that he was so entirely one of us,\nthat a compliment to him would seem like a compli-\nment to ourselves. Messrs. Giddings and Hutchin-\nson were our guests, and therefore entitled to our\nthanks. This sentiment was warmly applauded.\n\nThe Cuarrman said he was glad to see that we\nhad with us, on the occasion, two of the Christiana\nTraitors; whereupon there was a ery, \u2018Let them\ncome to the platform. In. this call Mr, Giddings\njoined, and Castyer Hanway and Evian Lewis,\nthough naturally reluctant to exhibit themselves, took\ntheir place on the platform amidst the most tempest-\nuous cheers. Mr. Giddings, standing between them,\nand taking them by the nand, said: \u2018I declare to\nyou, my friends, that I am far prouder in being able\nto grasp the handscf these brave men, than | should\nbe to receive the applause of the mightiest prince\nthat ever trod the footstool of the Almighty\u201d The\ncheers which followed this were tremendous.\n\n \n\f"

We did not think\nit possible that the men who have urged on these\nprosecutions for treason in the face of law and com-\nmon sense, and in a spirit disgraceful to the age,\ncould possibly do any thing, that would excite our\nsurprise ; but this act of superlative meanness ex-\ncites our amazement as well as indignation. Judge\nGrier, when his attention was first called to the\nsubject, admitted distinctly that the Government\nwas bound to pay the witnesses, but as some of his\nerders had been reviewed by the officers of the\nTreasury at Wsshington, he did not wish to act in\nthe case, and would leave it to bis brother Kane.\nThe qnestion cime up for argument on Friday last.\nMr. Ashmead resisted the payment of the witnesses,\nand Messrs. Read and Cuyler contended manfully\nagainst the meann\u00e9ss and injustice of refusing to\npay them ; but, as we understand the matter, Judge\nKane, in the exercise of a discretion which the law\ngives him, decided that they should not be paid! It\nis not pretended, we believe, that the law required\nsuch a decision, though it is contended that it did not\nforbid it. But, independent ofall legal technicalities,\njust consider how base it is, on the part of the Gov-\nernment, to compel Castner Hanway to pay his own\nwitnesses. He had been charged, as the facts ex-\nhibited during the trial fully proved, with an offence\nof which he was entirely innocent\u2014an offence, too,\nthe penalty of which is death. He had spent three\nmonths in prison upon a charge which no intelligent\nlawyer, whose brains were not utterly obfuscated\nby the sorceries of the Slave Power, could one mo-\nment expect to prove. A poor man, dependent upon\nhis labor for the support of his family, he had been\ndenied bail, and thus not only cut off from all op-\nportunity of earning his bread, but subjected to se-\nvere losses from the interruption of his business.\nHis health, too, had suffered severely from the un-\nwholesome air of the prison. Afier enduring all\nthis, and after demonstrating his entire innocence\nof the charge brought against him, the Court had\nthe meanness to subject him to the liability of toiling\nfor years to pay the witnesses who had been suin-\nmoned to testify in his behalf. And Mr. Ashmead\neven had the effrontery to insist that he had been ac-\nquitted only on a mere technicality\u2014that he was\nguilty in fact, though not in form!\n\nThis is an outrage upon justice, of which we find\nit difficult to speak with any degree of calmness.\n\nWhile Castner Hanway, (as a punishment, we sup-\npose, for not being guilty of treason when the Gov-\nernment wanted a victim!) is compelled to pay his\nwitnesses, even though it shall make him a beggar,\nMr. Ashmead is allowed to put his hand in Uncle\nSam\u2019s purse not only for his own fees, but for the\naccommadation of any of the slave-catching tribe\nwhom it was his pleasure to summon to Philadelphia\nduring the trial. The Rey. Mr. Gorsuch, son of the\nman who was killed at Christiana, who knew noth-\ning whatever of the circumstances, and who was not\neven put upon the stand, was accommodated by Mr.\nAshmead with a subpena, to enable him to remain\nin Philadelphia, at the expense of the United States,\nduoing the progress of the trial. How long will\ninjustice like this be toJerated in Pennsylvania ?\n\n \n\n \n\f"

His welcome\nhas been hearty, spontaneous, and multitudinous, be-\nyond any weleome ever before extended in England\n(0 a foreigner, without rank, title, government favor,\nor court patronage. In Manchester [ saw him, when,\neven according to the J'%mes\u2019 reporter, 200,000 peo-\nple turned ont to meet him. I was told by another\nreporter, (not from the T%mes,) on the same occasion,\nhat the welcome he then received was fully as cor-\nJjal as that accorded to our justly popular Sovereign\nherself,\n\nKossuth\u2019s name is now among our household\nwords. { will venture to say, that within the last\nmonth it has been ten times in our hearts and on our\n\u2018ips, for once that we have thought or spoken of any\nother public man. He is the symbol of the trust\nind Jove of a gallant but down-trodden people.\nHis cause is felt to be ourown. Though houseless,\nhomeless, and bereft of political power, his moral\ninfluence is prodigious, We know that all the des-\npots in Europe tremble at his name. We know that\nhe unbought love and sympathies of Great Britain\nhave added immensely to his influence and his im-\nportance,\n\nWell, then, he is to sail for America to-morrow. |\nHe will, doubtless, be received with great pomp and |\ncircumstance by the government, and with hearty\nenthusiasm by millions in the great republic. I re-\noice in the freedom of America, 1 rejoice that she\nis the asylum. of millions from the old countries of\nEurope, and especially my own, who find \u00abbandance\nind comfort there, which no industry could secure\nto them under the feudal institutions and bad land\njaws in their native land. Bat I know that if Amer-\n2a has great privileges, she is also a country of ter-\nible oppressions and gigantic crimes. I know there\niS no country where so many mean men do the cru-\nllest and wickedest things for the sake of money.\nhe slaves in America are nearly as numerous as\nthe Magyars. They are held by the people of half\nthe States, the slave States, in a condition so strip-\nped of civil, religious, and personal rights, that the\nRussian serfs and the very Neapolitans are happy\nin comparison. If they escape into the free States,\noe they maids, wives, mothers, little children, or old\nnen, it matters not. There are thousands \u2018in the\nree States, who say the Union must be preserved at\niny price, and there are multitudes more, so callous\nfo all shame, so athirst for money, that they are\nready ata call to play the doubie part of Judas and\nhe bloodhound for a very trifling consideration in\nnard cash. Thus, owing to the slave system, and\nthe assumed political necessity of maintaining it, in\norder that the Union may ,be held together\u2014of do-\ning the wickedest. meanest, most abominable acts of\n\u2018reachery and cruelty for the direct love of money,\nor the maintenance of a detestable compact\u2014it\ncomes to pass that an obtuseness of moral feeling, a\nblindness. to the clearest requisitions of Christ and\nhumanity prevail, even in the free States, which are\nnot surpassed or equalled in Russia, in Naples, or in\nDahomey.\n\nThis being the simple fact, I ask, \u2018Is Kossuth\nsafe in the United States?\u2019 I do not donbt that he\n\n \n\f"

ALLEN.\n\nFrepericx Doverass, Ese.\u2014Dear Sirn:\u2014You\nhave seen the address of the colored people of New\nYork city to Kossuth. What a stupendously fool-\nish thing! Nota word of their own wrongs\u2014their\nsofferings\u2014their enslavement ;\u2014no point, no direct-\nness, no nothing, except the mere rhetoric. Pal-\naver, the whole of it; and to cap the climax of ab-\nsurdities, the address winds up with the assurance to\nthe Hungarian, that, on the day of giving, they (the\ncolored people) will be on hand with at least the\n* widow\u2019s mite, if no more. Where did mortal man\never read of such folly as this before? Just as\nthough, if the colored people are to invest money\nfor the benefit of the oppressed, justice, consistency,\nand the commonest self-respect, do not require that\nsuch money should be expended in some way for\nthe benefit of the four millions in our own land who\nare ground to the dust in chains and slavery, and\nthe tens of thousands of others, who, by cruel laws\nand customs are kept in poverty and degradation.\n\nThe men who wrote that address are not fools,\nNo equal number of men ia the Union can present a\ngreater amount of native intellect and talent; and\nin education and accomplishments, some of the mem-\nbers of that committee are by no. means inferior to\nthe most favored of their oppressors. How much\nthe more guilty then are they! I cannot let them\ngo gently by. Though no other colored man should\nspeak out, I, for one, will do so; and Jet it be known,\nthat there is at least one of the oppressed in Ameri-\nca, whose feelings that address, lacking, as it does,\nso much of vitality, does not represent, and who can\nfind next to nothing to applaud in so ridiculous a\nperformance.\n\nThe address, milk and water as it was, failed to\nmake any impression upon Kossuth ; and, as a mat-\nter of course, he treated those who presented it with\nthe most withering contempt. \u2018 Gentlemen, the time\nfor addresses is past, and the time for action has come.\u2019\nIf that isn\u2019t \u2018summary? I should like to know what\nis? Poor men! how they must have felt as they\nsneaked away from his presence!\n\nKossuth is a man of matchless power of mind.\nHe sets aside all orators, whether of ancient or\nmodern date. He is positively an intellectual won-\nder. Nevertheless, he has proved himself not only\nmortal man, but capable of cherishing views and feel-\nings which are not in accordance with the laws that\nlie at the basis of our common humanity, and which\nbind us together in one bond of general brotherhood.\n\nKossuth is not asked to turn anti-slavery J\u00e9cturer,\nthongh this is what Wright of the Commonwealth\ncharges upon Wm. Lloyd Garrison. He is not ask-\ned to turn aside from the Hungarian cause, or to\ndivide his energies between the cause of the Ameri-\ncan slave, and that of the Hungarian oppressed.\nNobody but a foo! would ask that. He is simply\nasked to do nothing or say nothing while here, which\nwould imply that he regarded the liberty of the\nAmerican black man as Jess sacred than that of the\nHungarian white man: in other words, be is simply\nasked to see that there does exist among us such an\ninstitution as American Slavery, and to utter to the\nAmericans, face to face, one burning rebuke by way\nof its condemnation. Do less than this, he could\nnot, and maintain his integrity; and doing less than\nthis, it is my prayer at least, that such \u2018Apostles of\nliberty\u2019? as he, may be fewer than ever were angels\u2019\nvisits, and a great deal farther between.\n\n\u2018My principle, says Kossuth, in his card, \u2018in this\nrespect 13, that every nation has the sovereign right to\ndispose of ils own domestic affuirs, without any for-\neign interference ; that I therefore shall not meddle\nwith any domestic concerns of the United States.\nFour millions ofe Africans and their descendants,\ntherefore, may toil on ina worse slavery than ever\nthe Hungarian knew ; and, for all Kossuth cares, the\ndevil catch them at last. \u2018This is benevolence, sure-\nly! Why comes he here to incuce us to meddle with\nthe \u2018domestic concerns\u2019 of Austria? If the enslave-\nment of the blacks to the whites in this country be\na \u201cdomestic concern, then the oppressed condition\nof the Hungarians to the Austrians is a \u2018domestic\nconcern.\u201d And if, being a \u2018domestic concern,\u2019 the\nenslavement of the one class be outside of his no-\ntice. then why, with equal justice, should not the op-\npressed condition of the other class, being a \u2018domes-\ntic concern,\u2019 be outside of our notice? O, consis-\ntency, thou art a jewel!\u2014and, besides, I ate\nhypocrisy.\n\nThe plain-trath is, Kogguth\u2019s disclaimer will get\nhim more money; but it known unto him, that\nmoney gotten thus will curse him, and not bless him.\n\nSome men I know at this point read us lectures on\n\u2018Common Sense.\u2019 Let them read on. [acknowledge\nno common sense which is in contravention of the\nlaw of rectitude.\n\nMuch better would it have been for the cause of\nfreedom the world over, had Kossuth maintained his\nintegrity. One word from him to this people would\nhave startled this nation into a sense of propriety\nnever felt before; and would have given such an im-\npetus to the cause of freedom as would almost have\nenabled us to fix the very day when the good time\nshould come.

It is not enough that in the American Con-\ngress, he is compared with George Thompson, the\nbosom friend of Mr. Garrison, It 1s not enough that\ntwenty-two Representatives of slave property voted\nagainst a resolution of welcome to him. O, no! It\nwould not be enough for Garrison, if he should say\nthat slavery was wrong, wicked and hypocritical,\nunless he could show his opposition to it in precisely\nthe way marked out by the editor of the Liberator,\nand his Boston clique of the American Anti-Slavery\nplatform. He must say, in answer to the delega-\ntions\u2014\u2018 Your Constitntion is a covenant with death\nand an agreement with hell,\u2019 and \u2018 your American\nchurch is a brotherhood of thieves ;\u2019 your politicians\nand your ministers are hypocrites and liars, and your\ngovernment is the most hypocritical on earth;\u2019 and,\nabove all, he must add, \u2018Great is the American An-\nti-Slavery Society, and Garrison is its prophet ;\u2019 (or,\nperhaps more truly, \u2018Great is the American Anti-\nSlavery Society, and i is Garrison\u2019s profit.)\n\nIf he would say this, he might have a handful of\nfriends, as long as he would place himself at their\ndisposal, to be denounced when he turned from the\ndictator\u2019s path,\n\f"

And he is right. We trust he\nIl heed nothing, care for nothing, think of noth-\ning, which can be tortured into a desire, much less\npurpose, of taking part or meddling in the political\ndivisions of the day in our Jand.\n\nWe notice that some of our friends are anxious\nthat he should express himself on the special ques-\n|tion of freedom, Why should they be ? Is not his\nlife one eloquent defence of freedom? Is not his\nspirit fall of the fire of liberty? Are not his teach-\nings, and all his speech, and his very presence, a\nsanctified and glorious embodiment of the doctrine\nof human brotherhood? For the United States, for\nthe world, he stands far above the passions and petty\nschemes which cause the marshalling of parties and\nthe planning of contests, and the contests themselves,\nas one of the world\u2019s best and purest master-spirits,\ntreading the path of a higher human freedom, and\npreparing the people every where to tread it with\nhim.\n\nThis is Kossuth\u2019s position. From him, therefore,\nwe would ask no word for any party, whether that\nparty be for or against freedom. From him we would\nseek no expression, if we could surely get it, which\nwould cause him to favor this or that political divi-\nsion in our country. Let him plead for Hungary and\nher freedom, with his whale soul, as no other living\nman can, and he will do more for liberty, the world\nover, than he would by any other course. Let him\ndo that, untrammelled, and with every free syinpathy\ncentering round and in him, and he will do more for\nfreedom in our land than any American could ac-\ncomplish,\n\n \n \n    \n\n \n\f"
